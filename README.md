# Intention-Timer

An app that allows users to set goals for their health and productivity and log their progress towards these goals.

## Overview

On the landing page the user can set a goal for three categories: study, meditate, or exercise. Once selected, the user will enter a description of the activity they will be working on and set a time limit for the activity. From here, the user will click the "start activity" button, which will bring them to a new page showing a timer with the time that they previously entered. When the user clicks "start", the timer will begin to count down and the user should perform their intended activity. When the time runs out, the timer will say "complete" and a "log activity" button will appear. Upon clicking the "log activity" button, a new activity card will appear on the right side of the screen under "past activities". This new card will show the details of the activity that was just completed. The user can then click "create new activity" to be brought back to the landing page and log a new activity. The app saves the data for all past activites. Each time the user opens the app, their previous activities will be shown on the right.
